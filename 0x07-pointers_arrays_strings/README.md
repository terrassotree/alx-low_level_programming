Project Name: C Programming Fundamentals
Description
The "C Programming Fundamentals" project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of essential concepts in the C programming language. This README file serves as a guide to explore three important topics: pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, and common C standard library functions for string manipulation.

Objectives
Pointers to Pointers:

Explain the concept of pointers to pointers in C.
Discuss the use cases and advantages of using pointers to pointers.
Provide examples to demonstrate how to declare, initialize, and access values using pointers to pointers.
Illustrate common scenarios where pointers to pointers are useful, such as dynamic memory allocation and modifying function arguments.
Multidimensional Arrays:

Define multidimensional arrays and their significance in C.
Explain how multidimensional arrays are stored in memory.
Discuss the syntax and declaration of multidimensional arrays.
Provide examples of accessing and manipulating elements in multidimensional arrays.
Demonstrate the use of multidimensional arrays in practical scenarios, such as matrices and tables.
Common C Standard Library Functions for String Manipulation:

Introduce the C standard library and its importance in C programming.
List and explain the most commonly used standard library functions for string manipulation, such as strlen, strcpy, strcat, strcmp, strchr, and strstr.
Provide examples showcasing the usage of these functions in different string operations.
Highlight important considerations and best practices when working with strings in C.
